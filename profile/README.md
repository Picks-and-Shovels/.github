## Introduction
Our 'Picks and Shovel' team participates in the **23-24 Google Solution Challenge**. We supports urban farmers and develops applications that encourage urban agriculture.

The purpose of our application is to provide useful tips and information to beginners in urban farming and to provide a platform for experienced urban farmers to share their knowledge.

The team's goal is to contribute to creating a 'Sustainable Cities and Communities' through urban agriculture and to enable many people to enjoy happiness in a better environment.
